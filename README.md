# CutUpsTwo
Early early prototype of solo project to emulate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1InCrzGIPU

Status: January 20, 2020 (on break to study for FAANG coding interview)

The end goal is a creativity helper app. In this case, it will, I hope, recreate the function of the so called cut-ups process of inspiration popularized originally by William S. Burroughs and then by David Bowie and Radiohead. The basic concept is to have a set of cohesive text (like a book page, a poem, a journal entry, etc) that one would physically cut up and reaarrange to see what novel word associations might appear. Examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1InCrzGIPU. 


The current iteration is a very early draft. Currently I have hi-jacked my main root view button to link to a document text analyizer view just to mess around with the API which I have never used before. I hope to be able to use this as an additional data source in the future. I am using code from apples' sample project for the API currently. The button normally takes an amount of text in the text view and allows a user to cut dynamically using the placement of the iphone cursor.  That text can then be rearanged tactically via a table view controller with drag and drop.
