    The Cut-up technique is a creativity process originally popularized by the DADAists. It involves cutting up existing text sources and rearranging them to inspire new ideas. The method was later used by William S. Burroughs, David Bowie, and Radiohead among others. See the wikipedia entry for a detailied history. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique.
    
    Instructions:

    ‚Ä¢) Paste in any copied text such as a poem, lyrics, a journal or diary entry-- even *news articles(although these may require more care in formatting into separate lines). Paste in any text you want.
    
    ‚Ä¢) Any text that is separated by a "return" will be counted as a new line.

    ‚Ä¢) Pick a Cut-up option by clicking on the scissors icon. A single line is anything separated by a "carraige return". Most text pasted from the interenet will have new line formatting in them already. You can also use the iOS keyboard to add new line separations manually. The options of single words, every fifth word,  and every third word will split the text into their respective sizes. Once the text is cut it will be sent to the editing board which you can access by clicking the Edit button.

    ‚Ä¢) A Fold-in is another option you can use. This is a method by which two separate pages of text are "folded" together. Imagine taking page one of a book and ripping it out and folding it down the middle and laying it down so only the first half of that page is showing. Now imagine taking, say, page one-hundred of that same book, folding it down the middle and laying it down so that only the seccond half of that page is showing. Now place the first folded page next to the second folded page and read across the lines as if they were a single page. See what happens.

    ‚Ä¢) Feel free to type in extra lines on the fly or edit existing lines using the keyboard.
    
    ‚Ä¢) Copying and pasting from different sources is a good way to get interesting blends.

    ‚Ä¢) You can click on the üì∑ to input text from physical source materials. You can scan text on the fly or use a picture of a text source from your photo library.

    ‚Ä¢) The random button will pull in a completely randomized snippet of text from a book from gutenberg.org. the fomratting will most likely need to be cleaned up manually.
        
    ‚Ä¢) Once you have cut your initial text, click on Edit to go to the editing board.

    ‚Ä¢) Rearranging can be done manually by dragging and dropping lines, or automatically by clicking the üîÄ button. You can press shuffle as many times as you wish.
    
    ‚Ä¢) You can go back to the input screen and add more content at any time.

    ‚Ä¢) Clicking on "Save" on the editing board will allow you to save your current cut-up to work on later. 
    
    ‚Ä¢) Export your rearranged lines via the ‚èç button.

    ‚Ä¢) Press the üóë button to start over completely.
